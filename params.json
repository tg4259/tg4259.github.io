These were some of the questions that I wanted to see if I could answer for myself by recreating life extension studies that I had read about in science publications where the life span of animal models was increased by 10-20% or more. These studies indicated that aging was a controllable process that could be hacked, by inhibiting mTor pathways. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_development_of_mTOR_inhibitors). These pathways it is speculated, have evolved in animals under stress by lack of food in order to survive until food is more abundant, could be hacked by CR caloric restriction or the use of Rapamycin, both mTor inhibitors. Once I got comfortable in the lab I would use the skills learned at the BioHack Academy to see if the experiments could be duplicated and if the results would be convincing _(below - worm action-hero)_\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11135089/6810357/66e1c326-d260-11e4-831f-187f7efae7f7.jpg)\r\n\r\nI read all the life extension/longevity documentation I could find, along with Youtube videos and the first decision I needed to make was a choice of animal model to use. Mice were too long lived my purposes, fruit flies could be hard to wrangle and prospect of watching yeast age didn't seem too exciting so I settled on c.elegans (microscopic earth worms). The use of these beautiful creatures was first pioneered by Nobel Prize winner Sydney Brenner (2002 Medicine) as an animal model. The life cycle is short 3-5 days, they are prolific reproducers and I could maintain them with a diet of e.coli. Conceptually I was ready to rock & roll.\r\n\r\nC.elegans -Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc1P7lGSzdU\r\n\r\nWormbook - Maintanence http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strainmaintain/strainmaintain.html\r\n\r\n### Getting worms (take away - Scientists are really generous).\r\n\r\n**This email below was sent to (7) 'googled' researchers (3) replied positively:** Jeroen van Zon of AMOLF research Amsterdam answered my request http://www.amolf.nl/.\r\n\r\nThe following is a request for assistance with a developmental biology experiment being conducted at the Waag Society of Amsterdam - institute for art, science and technology (www.waag.org). I understand you are using c. elegans at your lab and my request for a donation of c. elegans, NGM medium or any other cultivation material for the project. The organisms will be used to study the reproducibility of longevity experiments (details below) recently publish.\r\nLab supervisors Pieter van Boheemen (Pieter@waag.org) or María Boto Ordóñez (mboto@ub.edu) may be contacted or Waag Society (lucas@waag.org).\r\n \r\nPlease forward this to any colleagues who may be able to help in this request. The organizations will be credited in the publically available results. Details of the project are below and I can be contacted for any further information. Thanks in advance for your cooperation, Tony Garcia.\r\n \r\n###The life extension/longevity experiment (conceptual 1st draft which is still evolving)\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nDevelopmental Biology - Reproduction of aging/longevity studies\r\nThis project will explore the ability to reproduce aging/longevity studies results using mTOR inhibitors – Rapamycin/Sirolimus a biosynthesized molecule, Streptomyces hygroscopicus (biohazard 1) the original target bacteria which produces Rapamycin and Caloric Restriction CR.  All three have been attributed to extending life in various animal and insect studies. The results of this project will be publically posted.\r\n\r\nRapamycin (also called Sirolimus):\r\nThis chemical discovered by Suren Sehgal and is a product of bacteria found on Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui). Biosynthesized it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 1999 and is marketed under the trade name Rapamune by Pfizer.\r\n\r\nmTor inhibitors refers to (metabolic target of Rapamycin) this molecule inhibits IL-2 and other cytokines receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. Since Rapamycin or mTOR inhibitors have been biosynthesized they have been used for a number of years for organ transplants to inhibit transplant rejection. _(below - worm food OP50)_\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11135089/6810515/7ce79e6a-d261-11e4-9a47-3bc3678efab5.jpg)\r\n\r\nBacteria - Streptomyces hygroscopicus (biohazard 1):\r\nSirolimus (also known as Rapamycin) is a product of bacteria Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Rapamycin/Sirolimus was originally developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned once it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative properties. It has since been shown to prolong the life of mice and might also be useful in the treatment of certain cancers.\r\n\r\nCalorie Restriction CR:\r\nCaloric Restriction without malnutrition has been shown to extend life in a variety of species, among them yeast, fish, rodents and dogs. It decelerates the biological aging process, resulting in longer maintenance of youthful health and an increase in both median and maximum lifespan. _(below - worm family feeding on OP50 e.coli)_\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11135089/6810437/fac0d7f8-d260-11e4-9bfa-e2d91c507c6d.jpg)\r\n\r\nTest organism – c. elegans\r\nCultivation - The life cycle of the worm is about 3 days.\r\nFeeding - In the lab, Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain OP50.\r\n\r\nLongevity testing protocol\r\nOnce c. elegans has be incubated, then synchronized and transferred to a colony plate. The target c. elegans colony will be divided into 4 control plus a control group and fed and monitored over a period of one life cycle.\r\n \r\nThis same protocol will be repeated over a number of colony life cycles with varying solutions of biologics, bacteria or food restriction. The longevity/health will be measured in days/hours/minutes of survival. The results will be calculated by averaging the totals of each group with specific dilution mixture. Part of the results will identify the optimal dilution regime that correlates to longevity and health. \r\n\r\n###Worm wrangling (Move to day Zer0)\r\n \r\nThe worms gifted to me from AMOLF researchers in Amsterdam were in two 6cm petri dishes. Along with these were two dishes of OP50 (e.coli worm food). I incubated them for a week and both colonies flourished. To make this experiment a success one has to be able to transfer the worms from one prepared petri dish filled with NGM (nemetode growth medium) to another. To feed the worm with a standardized amount of food OP50 (e.coli strain). To distinguish between long lived animals and younger ones (using markers of size, mobility etc). One has to be able manipulate the worms with confidence moving them from one petri dish to another to eventually synchronize them for a day zero. Only then can the experiment begin. All of the above it takes time, patience and a steady hand. _(moving worms with an injection needle) _\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11135089/6917338/da668186-d7a3-11e4-9f15-9b442e38b9ad.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n###The heartbreak of worm wrangling (continued - the move to day Zer0)\r\n\r\nMy worm transfer to 3.5cm petri dishes was not totally successful. Out of 20 petri dishes transferred from the original colony only 3 were successful. I also realized that to synchronize the worms (creating a day zero for the start of the experiment) I needed to make a much larger batch of worms and then let the colony starve out leaving only their eggs. I would then separate the eggs into different dishes then introduce different nutrients to see whether the colony benefits from it. With time running out for the BioHack academy I am not sure what will be the next steps of the experiment. (Try this at home boys & girls!! - Reciepes for NGM mix, worm feed and care are included at the end of the blog)\r\n\r\nOpen worm – c.elegans in Silico\r\n\r\nhttp://www.openworm.org/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r00FkkGFfrg\r\n\r\n###Why this experiment might not work (and why being dumb can be a good thing)\r\n\r\nTen years ago John Ioannidies published a paper called 'Why most research findings are false'. The following is an part of the abstract: \"There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field.\"  (full article - http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)\r\n\r\nI also emailed googled Longevity researchers like Matt Kaeberlein of Kaeberlein Lab for advice http://kaeberleinlab.org/ (Again scientist are super generous) Matt wrote: 'Best of luck with your C. elegans studies.  If your experience is like ours, you will find that about half of what’s in the C. elegans aging literature is not consistently reproducible.  There are a variety of factors that contribute to this, including often incomplete or inaccurate methods descriptions as well as insufficient replication in the initial reports.  Relatively modest temperature and food density fluctuations can often obscure smaller lifespan effects as well.  You will also want to consider how to handle censoring of animals for things like bagging (assuming you don’t use FUDR), rupture, burrowing, contamination, and crawling of the plates.  It all makes a difference.  That’s why I’ve adopted the approach that we stick to large magnitude effects in my lab that work every time we do the experiment'.  \r\n\r\n### Let the race for long life begin! (delusions grandeur of a would-be dictator in the land of worms)\r\n\r\nStill even with the uncertainty of getting any results I was committed to lead my worms on the glorious path to long-life. I transferred my surviving c.elegans into new 6cm petri dishes but without being able to synchronize them, because I had run out of time. \r\n\r\nI had finally got my hands on a batch of Rapamycin, the mTor inhibitor in week 8 of the 10 week Biohack course and felt I could command the worms to do my bidding. I had built up high expectations so I pushed forward with my master plan hoping to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat - But to do this I had to further compromise the integrity of my experiment.\r\n\r\nI introduced Rapamycin into their petri dishes in dilutions of 1:200, 1:2000 & 1:20000 and hoped for long life and glory. I further adjusted the experiment eliminating CR caloric restriction from their menu. My worms had been through a lot and I didn't want to make their life anymore difficult than it was - now I am waiting for results.\r\n\r\n### Trying out the longevity juice - (Rapamycin) - Philosophical questions\r\n\r\n* Is aging inevitable or is it a controlled process that can be slowed?\r\n\r\n* What will it take for this experiment to produce convincing results? Scaling up - How can human tests be designed for longevity?\r\n\r\n* What is compelling proof? If results of longevity experiment are convincing - who gets the juice?\r\n\r\n* Do we follow the Pharma-patent business model or should longevity be available for all?\r\n\r\n* What implications does longevity have for society? - Optimistic story (tweeking the societal order) and pessimistic story (limited resources)\r\n\r\n* What are the risk/benefit calculations involved?\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### Support documentation\r\n\r\nNGM agar plates\r\nFor 1 liter/333ml:\r\n- 3g/1g NaCl\r\n- 17g/5.7g Bacto-agar\r\n- 2.5g/0.83g Bacto-peptone\r\n- 1ml/0.33ml cholesterol (5mg/ml stock in 100% ethanol)\r\n- dH20 to ~975ml/325ml\r\n- autoclave, let cool to 55C (until you can touch it with your hand without discomfort), then add:\r\n- 1ml/0.33ml 1M CaCl2 (stock)\r\n- 1ml/0.33ml 1M MgSO4 (stock)\r\n- 25ml/8.3ml 1M KPO4 pH 6 (stock)\r\n- swirl thoroughly after each addition.\r\n- When all added, pour plates. (~25 ml for 10cm plate, ~10ml for 5 cm plate)\r\n    10ml for 10cm plates, 5 ml for 6cm plates, 2ml for 3.5cm plates\r\n- To remove air bubbles in agar, flame agar surface\r\n- Dry plates upside-down with lids slightly ajar for 1-2 hours at 37C, or upside-up with lids closed for 2-3 days at room temperature.\r\n- Store upside-down in sealed plastic box at 4C\r\nBecause the autoclaving step takes 1.5-2hr, it is often more convenient to let the NGM agar solidy after autoclaving and then melt it in the microwave at a later point. In this case, make ~333ml in a 500ml bottle. If using multiple bottles, make each bottle separately because the agar doesn’t fully dissolve and is hard to divide up later. Melt agar by microwaving for 4min. Do not microwave too long or the agar will overboil. Small chunks of solid agar will melt while the agar is cooling down. The molten agar will be ready to be poured after 20-25 mins at RT. If you worry about the agar being too cold, microwave it for an additional 30s. \r\n\r\nSeeding NGM agar plates with OP50\r\n- Seed 50 ml B broth with single OP50 colony. Incubate at 37C overnight\r\n- Add ~1 ml of OP50 in B broth to 10cm NGM plate.\r\n- Swirl plates to distribute OP50, incubate overnight at 37C\r\n- Store upside-down in sealed plastic bag at room temperature.\r\n\r\nLB Amp plates (for RNAi bacteria)\r\n- 10 g tryptone\r\n- 5 g yeast extract\r\n- 10 g NaCl\r\n- (The above can be replaced by 25 g DIFCO LB broth)\r\n- 15 g agar\r\n- Add dH20 to 1 liter\r\n- Autoclave, let cool to 55C (until you can touch it with your hand with discomfort), then:\r\n- Add Ampicilin to 50 ug/ml, i.e. 1 ml 1000X Ampicilin stock\r\n- Pour plates\r\nFreezing worms\r\n- Wash worms from plate with 3x 5ml M9 solutions into 15 ml Falcon tube. Preferably use a plate that has just starved and contains many L1 larvae\r\n- Spin worms down 1 min 2000 rpm \r\n- Aspirate using clean tip to 1.5 ml\r\n- Add 1.5 ml freezing solution. Work sterile to prevent contamination of freezing solution stock.\r\n- Aliquot 1 ml into liquid nitrogen cryotubes (with a screw cap) 3 tubes fot each strain\r\n- Freeze slowly to -80C. This is done by putting the cryotubes in the worm freezing box: two styrofoam racks (the ones that 15 ml Falcon tubes come in) on top of one another, fastened together by a rubber band.\r\n- The next day, move two of the tubes to a permanent location in the freezer.\r\n- Use the third tube for a test thaw: thaw the contents of the tube quickly by holding in your hand. Dump the contents onto a large seeded plate\r\n- Check for live worms after a day or so.\r\n- Note date of freezing and succesful testthaw in strain database (Gmail account)\r\n\r\nFreezing bacteria\r\n- Grow bacteria overnight in LB\r\n- Add an equal volume of 60% glycerol (autoclaved)\r\n- Aliquot 1ml into at least two cryovials\r\n- Freeze at -80C\r\n\r\nSynchronization by washing\r\n- Grow plate with many eggs\r\n- Wash plate with dH2O, aspirate to make sure all liquid is gone.
