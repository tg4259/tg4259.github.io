<p>Is aging something that can be stopped, slowed down or reversed? These were some of the questions that I wanted to see if I could answer for myself by recreating life extension studies that I had read about in science publications where the life span of animal models was increased by 10-20% or more. These studies indicated that aging was a controllable process that could be hacked, by inhibiting mTor pathways. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_development_of_mTOR_inhibitors">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_development_of_mTOR_inhibitors</a>). These pathways could be hacked by CR caloric restriction or the use of Rapamycin, both mTor inhibitors. Once I got comfortable in the lab I would use the skills learned at the BioHack Academy to see if the experiments could be duplicated and if the results would be convincing <em>(below - worm action-hero)</em></p>

<p>I read all the life extension/longevity documentation I could find, along with Youtube videos and the first decision I needed to make was a choice of animal model to use. Mice were too long lived my purposes, fruit flies could be hard to wrangle and prospect of watching yeast age didn't seem too exciting so I settled on c.elegans (microscopic earth worms). The use of these beautiful creatures was first pioneered by Nobel Prize winner Sydney Brenner (2002 Medicine) as an animal model. The life cycle is short 3-5 days, they are prolific reproducers and I could maintain them with a diet of e.coli. Conceptually I was ready to rock &amp; roll.</p>

<p>Developmental Biology - Reproduction of aging/longevity studies
This project will explore the ability to reproduce aging/longevity studies results using mTOR inhibitors – Rapamycin/Sirolimus a biosynthesized molecule, Streptomyces hygroscopicus (biohazard 1) the original target bacteria which produces Rapamycin and Caloric Restriction CR.  All three have been attributed to extending life in various animal and insect studies. The results of this project will be publically posted.</p>

<p>Rapamycin (also called Sirolimus):
This chemical discovered by Suren Sehgal and is a product of bacteria found on Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui). Biosynthesized it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 1999 and is marketed under the trade name Rapamune by Pfizer.</p>

<p>mTor inhibitors refers to (metabolic target of Rapamycin) this molecule inhibits IL-2 and other cytokines receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. Since Rapamycin or mTOR inhibitors have been biosynthesized they have been used for a number of years for organ transplants to inhibit transplant rejection. <em>(below - worm food OP50)</em></p>

<p>Bacteria - Streptomyces hygroscopicus (biohazard 1):
Sirolimus (also known as Rapamycin) is a product of bacteria Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Rapamycin/Sirolimus was originally developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned once it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative properties. It has since been shown to prolong the life of mice and might also be useful in the treatment of certain cancers.</p>

<p>Calorie Restriction CR:
Caloric Restriction without malnutrition has been shown to extend life in a variety of species, among them yeast, fish, rodents and dogs. It decelerates the biological aging process, resulting in longer maintenance of youthful health and an increase in both median and maximum lifespan. <em>(below - worm family feeding on OP50 e.coli)</em></p>

<p>Test organism – c. elegans
Cultivation - The life cycle of the worm is about 3 days.
Feeding - In the lab, Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain OP50.</p>

<p>Longevity testing protocol
Once c. elegans has be incubated, then synchronized and transferred to a colony plate. The target c. elegans colony will be divided into 4 control plus a control group and fed and monitored over a period of one life cycle.</p>

<p>This same protocol will be repeated over a number of colony life cycles with varying solutions of biologics, bacteria or food restriction. The longevity/health will be measured in days/hours/minutes of survival. The results will be calculated by averaging the totals of each group with specific dilution mixture. Part of the results will identify the optimal dilution regime that correlates to longevity and health. </p>

<p>The worms gifted to me from AMOLF researchers in Amsterdam were in two 6cm petri dishes. Along with these were two dishes of OP50 (e.coli worm food). I incubated them for a week and both colonies flourished. To make this experiment a success one has to be able to transfer the worms from one prepared petri dish filled with NGM (nemetode growth medium) to another. To feed the worm with a standardized amount of food OP50 (e.coli strain). To distinguish between long lived animals and younger ones (using markers of size, mobility etc). One has to be able manipulate the worms with confidence moving them from one petri dish to another to eventually synchronize them for a day zero. Only then can the experiment begin. All of the above it takes time, patience and a steady hand. _(moving worms with an injection needle) _</p>

<p>My worm transfer to 3.5cm petri dishes was not totally successful. Out of 20 petri dishes transferred from the original colony only 3 were successful. I also realized that to synchronize the worms (creating a day zero for the start of the experiment) I needed to make a much larger batch of worms and then let the colony starve out leaving only their eggs. I would then separate the eggs into different dishes then introduce different nutrients to see whether the colony benefits from it. With time running out for the BioHack academy I am not sure what will be the next steps of the experiment. (Try this at home boys &amp; girls!! - Reciepes for NGM mix, worm feed and care are included at the end of the blog)</p>

<p>Ten years ago John Ioannidies published a paper called 'Why most research findings are false'. The following is an part of the abstract: "There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field."  (full article - <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124</a>)</p>

<p>I also emailed googled Longevity researchers like Matt Kaeberlein of Kaeberlein Lab for advice <a href="http://kaeberleinlab.org/">http://kaeberleinlab.org/</a> (Again scientist are super generous) Matt wrote: 'Best of luck with your C. elegans studies.  If your experience is like ours, you will find that about half of what’s in the C. elegans aging literature is not consistently reproducible.  There are a variety of factors that contribute to this, including often incomplete or inaccurate methods descriptions as well as insufficient replication in the initial reports.  Relatively modest temperature and food density fluctuations can often obscure smaller lifespan effects as well.  You will also want to consider how to handle censoring of animals for things like bagging (assuming you don’t use FUDR), rupture, burrowing, contamination, and crawling of the plates.  It all makes a difference.  That’s why I’ve adopted the approach that we stick to large magnitude effects in my lab that work every time we do the experiment'.  </p>

(delusions grandeur would-be dictator in the land of worms)</h3>

<p>Still even with the uncertainty of getting any results I was committed to lead my worms to glorious long-life. I transferred my surviving c.elegans into new 6cm petri dishes but without being able to synchronize to a day zer0, because I had run out of time. I had finally got my hands on a batch of Rapamycin in week 8 of the 10 week biohack course and felt comfortable in commanding them to do my bidding. My minions had high expectations of me so I pushed forward with my master plan with the intention of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat for my little followers. I introduced Rapamycin into their little lives and hoped for long life and glory. I further adjusted the experiment and eliminated CR caloric restriction from their menu. Me and my worms had been through a lot together and didn't want to make their life anymore difficult.</p>

<p>NGM agar plates
For 1 liter/333ml:</p>

<ul>
<li>3g/1g NaCl</li>
<li>17g/5.7g Bacto-agar</li>
<li>2.5g/0.83g Bacto-peptone</li>
<li>1ml/0.33ml cholesterol (5mg/ml stock in 100% ethanol)</li>
<li>dH20 to ~975ml/325ml</li>
<li>autoclave, let cool to 55C (until you can touch it with your hand without discomfort), then add:</li>
<li>1ml/0.33ml 1M CaCl2 (stock)</li>
<li>1ml/0.33ml 1M MgSO4 (stock)</li>
<li>25ml/8.3ml 1M KPO4 pH 6 (stock)</li>
<li>swirl thoroughly after each addition.</li>
<li>When all added, pour plates. (~25 ml for 10cm plate, ~10ml for 5 cm plate)
10ml for 10cm plates, 5 ml for 6cm plates, 2ml for 3.5cm plates</li>
<li>To remove air bubbles in agar, flame agar surface</li>
<li>Dry plates upside-down with lids slightly ajar for 1-2 hours at 37C, or upside-up with lids closed for 2-3 days at room temperature.</li>
<li>Store upside-down in sealed plastic box at 4C
Because the autoclaving step takes 1.5-2hr, it is often more convenient to let the NGM agar solidy after autoclaving and then melt it in the microwave at a later point. In this case, make ~333ml in a 500ml bottle. If using multiple bottles, make each bottle separately because the agar doesn’t fully dissolve and is hard to divide up later. Melt agar by microwaving for 4min. Do not microwave too long or the agar will overboil. Small chunks of solid agar will melt while the agar is cooling down. The molten agar will be ready to be poured after 20-25 mins at RT. If you worry about the agar being too cold, microwave it for an additional 30s. </li>
</ul>

<p>Seeding NGM agar plates with OP50</p>

<ul>
<li>Seed 50 ml B broth with single OP50 colony. Incubate at 37C overnight</li>
