<p>Is aging something that can be stopped, slowed down or reversed? These were some of the questions that I wanted to see if I could answer for myself by recreating life extension studies that I had read about in science publications where the life span of animal models was increased by 10-20%. I would use the skills learned at the BioHack Academy to see if the experiments could be duplicated. And find out if the results could be convincing? <em>(below - worm action-hero)</em></p>

<p>I read all the documentation I could find, along with Youtube videos and the first decision I needed to make was a choice of animal model to use. Mice were too long lived my purposes, fruit flies could be hard to wrangle and prospect of watching yeast grow and age didn't seem too exciting so I settled on c.elegans (microscopic earth worms). These beautiful creatures were first pioneered by Nobel Prize winner Stanley Brenner as an animal model. The life cycle is short 3-5 days, they are prolific reproducers and I could maintain them with a diet of e.coli. Conceptually I was ready to roll.</p>

<p>The following is a request for assistance with a developmental biology experiment being conducted at the Waag Society of Amsterdam - institute for art, science and technology (<a href="http://www.waag.org">www.waag.org</a>). I understand you are using c. elegans at your lab and my request for a donation of c. elegans, NGM medium or any other cultivation material for the project. The organisms will be used to study the reproducibility of longevity experiments (details below) recently publish.
Lab supervisors Pieter van Boheemen (<a href="mailto:Pieter@waag.org">Pieter@waag.org</a>) or María Boto Ordóñez (<a href="mailto:mboto@ub.edu">mboto@ub.edu</a>) may be contacted or Waag Society (<a href="mailto:lucas@waag.org">lucas@waag.org</a>).</p>

<p>Please forward this to any colleagues who may be able to help in this request. The organizations will be credited in the publically available results. Details of the project are below and I can be contacted for any further information. Thanks in advance for your cooperation, Tony Garcia.</p>

<p>Developmental Biology - Reproduction of aging/longevity studies
This project will explore the ability to reproduce aging/longevity studies results using mTOR inhibitors – Rapamycin/Sirolimus a biosynthesized molecule, Streptomyces hygroscopicus (biohazard 1) the original target bacteria which produces Rapamycin and Caloric Restriction CR.  All three have been attributed to extending life in various animal and insect studies. The results of this project will be publically posted.</p>

<p>Rapamycin (also called Sirolimus):
This chemical discovered by Suren Sehgal and is a product of bacteria found on Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui). Biosynthesized it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 1999 and is marketed under the trade name Rapamune by Pfizer.</p>

<p>mTor inhibitors refers to (metabolic target of Rapamycin) this molecule inhibits IL-2 and other cytokines receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. Since Rapamycin or mTOR inhibitors have been biosynthesized they have been used for a number of years for organ transplants to inhibit transplant rejection. <em>(below - worm food OP50)</em></p>

<p>Bacteria - Streptomyces hygroscopicus (biohazard 1):
Sirolimus (also known as Rapamycin) is a product of bacteria Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Rapamycin/Sirolimus was originally developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned once it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative properties. It has since been shown to prolong the life of mice and might also be useful in the treatment of certain cancers.</p>

<p>Calorie Restriction CR:
Caloric Restriction without malnutrition has been shown to extend life in a variety of species, among them yeast, fish, rodents and dogs. It decelerates the biological aging process, resulting in longer maintenance of youthful health and an increase in both median and maximum lifespan. <em>(below - worm family feeding)</em></p>

<p>Test organism – c. elegans
Cultivation - The life cycle of the worm is about 3 days.
Feeding - In the lab, Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain OP50.</p>

<p>Longevity testing protocol
Once c. elegans has be incubated and transferred to a colony plate. The target c. elegans colony will be divided into 4 control plus a control group and fed and monitored over a period of one life cycle.</p>

<p>This same protocol will be repeated over a number of colony life cycles with varying solutions of biologics, bacteria or food restriction. The longevity/health will be measured in days/hours/minutes of survival. The results will be calculated by averaging the totals of each group with specific dilution mixture. Part of the results will identify the optimal dilution regime that correlates to longevity and health. </p>

<p>The worms gifted to me from AMOLF researchers in Amsterdam were in two 6cm petri dishes. Along with these were two dishes of OP50 (e.coli worm food). I incubated them for a week and both colonies flourished. To make this experiment a success one has to be able to transfer the worms from one prepared petri dish filled with NGM (nemetode growth medium) to another. To feed the worm with a standardized amount of food OP50 (e.coli strain). To distinguish between long lived animals and younger ones (using markers of size, mobility etc). One has to be able manipulate the worms with confidence moving them from one petri dish to another to eventually synchronize them for a day zero. Only then can the experiment begin. All of the above will take time, patience and a steady hand. _(moving worms with an injection needle) _</p>

<p>My worm transfer was not totally successful. Out of 20 petri dishes transferred from the original colony only 3 were successful. I also realized that to synchronize the worms (creating a day zero for start of the experiment) I needed to make a much larger batch of worms and then let the colony starve out leaving only their eggs. I would then separate the eggs into different dishes then introduce different nutrients to see whether the colony benefits from th</p>

<p>Ten years ago John Ioannidies published a paper called 'Why most research findings are false'. The following is an part of the abstract: "There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field."

<ul>
<li><p>What will it take for this experiment to produce convincing results? Scaling up - How can human tests be designed for longevity?</p></li>
<li><p>What is compelling proof? If results of longevity experiment are convincing - who gets the juice?</p></li>
<li><p>Do we follow the Pharma-patent business model or should longevity be available for all?</p></li>
<li><p>What implications does longevity have for society? - Optimistic story (tweeking the societal order) and pessimistic story (limited resources)</p></li>
<li><p>What are the risk/benefit calculations involved?</p></li>
