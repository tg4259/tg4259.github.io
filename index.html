<p><strong>This email was sent to (7) 'googled' researchers (3) replied positively:</strong> </p>

<p>The following is a request for assistance with a developmental biology experiment being conducted at the Waag Society of Amsterdam - institute for art, science and technology (<a href="http://www.waag.org">www.waag.org</a>). I understand you are using c. elegans at your lab and my request for a donation of c. elegans, NGM medium or any other cultivation material for the project. The organisms will be used to study the reproducibility of longevity experiments (details below) recently publish.
Lab supervisors Pieter van Boheemen (<a href="mailto:Pieter@waag.org">Pieter@waag.org</a>) or María Boto Ordóñez (<a href="mailto:mboto@ub.edu">mboto@ub.edu</a>) may be contacted or Waag Society (<a href="mailto:lucas@waag.org">lucas@waag.org</a>).</p>

<p>Please forward this to any colleagues who may be able to help in this request. The organizations will be credited in the publically available results. Details of the project are below and I can be contacted for any further information. Thanks in advance for your cooperation, Tony Garcia.</p>

<p>Developmental Biology - Reproduction of aging/longevity studies
This project will explore the ability to reproduce aging/longevity studies results using mTOR inhibitors – Rapamycin/Sirolimus a biosynthesized molecule, Streptomyces hygroscopicus (biohazard 1) the original target bacteria which produces Rapamycin and Caloric Restriction CR.  All three have been attributed to extending life in various animal and insect studies. The results of this project will be publically posted.</p>

<p>Rapamycin (also called Sirolimus):
This chemical discovered by Suren Sehgal and is a product of bacteria found on Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui). Biosynthesized it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 1999 and is marketed under the trade name Rapamune by Pfizer.</p>

<p>mTor inhibitors refers to (metabolic target of Rapamycin) this molecule inhibits IL-2 and other cytokines receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. Since Rapamycin or mTOR inhibitors have been biosynthesized they have been used for a number of years for organ transplants to inhibit transplant rejection. </p>

<p>Bacteria - Streptomyces hygroscopicus (biohazard 1):
Sirolimus (also known as Rapamycin) is a product of bacteria Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Rapamycin/Sirolimus was originally developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned once it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative properties. It has since been shown to prolong the life of mice and might also be useful in the treatment of certain cancers.</p>

<p>Calorie Restriction CR:
Caloric Restriction without malnutrition has been shown to extend life in a variety of species, among them yeast, fish, rodents and dogs. It decelerates the biological aging process, resulting in longer maintenance of youthful health and an increase in both median and maximum lifespan.</p>

<p>Test organism – c. elegans
Cultivation - The life cycle of the worm is about 3 days.
Feeding - In the lab, Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain OP50.</p>

<p>Longevity testing protocol
Once c. elegans has be incubated and transferred to a colony plate. The target c. elegans colony will be divided into 4 control plus a control group and fed and monitored over a period of one life cycle.</p>

<p>This same protocol will be repeated over a number of colony life cycles with varying solutions of biologics, bacteria or food restriction. The longevity/health will be measured in days/hours/minutes of survival. The results will be calculated by averaging the totals of each group with specific dilution mixture. Part of the results will identify the optimal dilution regime that correlates to longevity and health. </p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
